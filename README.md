# Sentiment Analysis Project

This project provides a complete pipeline for sentiment analysis, including scripts and Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model building, training, prediction, and evaluation.

## Project Structure
- **main.py**: Script for data preprocessing, model creation, and training.
- **Prediction.ipynb**: Notebook for loading a trained model, making predictions, and evaluating results.
- **Sentiment_Analysis_project.ipynb**: End-to-end workflow for sentiment analysis, covering data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - sklearn
  - tensorflow (or keras)

## File Descriptions

### 1. main.py
**Purpose**: Handles data preprocessing, model creation, and training for sentiment analysis.
- **Main Sections**:
  - **Imports**: Essential libraries for data manipulation, machine learning, and deep learning.
  - **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Functions to load and clean text data.
  - **Model Building**: Defines a deep learning model for sentiment classification.
  - **Training and Saving the Model**: Trains the model on labeled data and saves it for later use.

### 2. Prediction.ipynb
**Purpose**: Uses a trained model to make sentiment predictions on new text data.
- **Main Sections**:
  - **Loading the Model**: Code to load a previously saved model.
  - **Input Processing**: Prepares input text data for model predictions.
  - **Prediction and Interpretation**: Code to predict sentiment labels (e.g., positive, negative) for text samples.
  - **Evaluation**: Displays metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 3. Sentiment_Analysis_project.ipynb
**Purpose**: Provides an end-to-end sentiment analysis workflow from data loading to model training and evaluation.
- **Main Sections**:
  - **Data Loading**: Loads and explores the sentiment dataset.
  - **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and tokenizes text data, possibly applies stemming or lemmatization.
  - **Model Training**: Builds and trains a deep learning model for sentiment analysis.
  - **Evaluation**: Displays evaluation metrics and confusion matrix.
  - **Results Visualization**: Shows charts or graphs for performance analysis.

## Usage

### Training the Model
1. Run `main.py` to preprocess the data, build the model, and train it on the sentiment dataset.
2. The trained model will be saved for use in prediction tasks.

### Making Predictions
1. Open `Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the notebook to load the model, input text data, and predict sentiment labels.

### End-to-End Analysis
1. Open `Sentiment_Analysis_project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the full workflow, starting from data loading to model evaluation and visualization.

## Results and Evaluation
The project includes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for assessing model performance. These metrics help evaluate the effectiveness of the model in identifying different sentiment classes.
